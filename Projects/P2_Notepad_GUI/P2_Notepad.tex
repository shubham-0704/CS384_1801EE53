You can use any online source code but for evaluation you need to explain each line of code. E.g.,

 \url{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/make-notepad-using-tkinter/}

Min Requirements for menu with functionality:

\textbf{File} Menu $ \longrightarrow  $ New, Open, Save, Save as, Exit.


\textbf{Edit} Menu  $ \longrightarrow  $  Cut, Copy, Paste, Find, Find \& Replace.

\textbf{Stats} Menu  $ \longrightarrow  $ Word Count, Char Count, Created Time, Modified time.

Assume only ASCII input is given to the notepad. It should open all ASCII based files like .c, .java, .py
etc.
